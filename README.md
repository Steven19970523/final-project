## Summary:
1.	Analyze the current drought condition in CONUS.

2.  Finding the severest year and compare with other years in decade.

3.  Analyze some potential reasons, including temperature, precipitation and soil misture, to figure out the correlation between drought and them.

4.  Roughly analyze the global impact of La NiNa.
